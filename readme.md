# vurt-cypher-cards

This project is to create cards for the [Vurt-The Roleplaying Game](http://www.ravendeskgames.com/vurt-the-tabletop-roleplaying-game).
The cards will be generated with the help of the ruby gem [Squib](https://github.com/andymeneely/squib) that will take a yaml file as input.

# Installation
